There is nothing to write about. Multi-module Maven builds just work.

If you know, how to build multi-module project with Maven, you know how to build multi-module Play! application.

There are two example builds:

For Play! 2.1.x - https://play2-maven-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/tags/test-projects-1.0.0-beta1/play21/multimodule

For Play! 2.2.x - https://play2-maven-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/tags/test-projects-1.0.0-beta1/play22/multimodule

For Play! 2.3.x - https://play2-maven-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/tags/test-projects-1.0.0-beta1/play23/multimodule
